Our algorithm:
Index hierarchical k-means, using k-means++.
calculate voronoi diagram on the lowest level clusters.
Convert the lowest level clusters to a graph. Every vertex has search status.
Each cluster holds a list of vectors.
Calculate vertex distance lower bound using the voronoi diagram.
Run nearest neighbors search using greedy search over the graph and pruning.

Datasets: MNIST, BERT embeddings of New York Times articles.

Evaluation: Number of comparisons, index time, retrieval time.

Compare to:
KD-Tree, brute search, epsilon-optimal search.

Find best k-means hyper parameters.

Prove optimality.
Find complexity upper bound (Theta(N)?).


Project Structure:
models part - receive dataset, nns in the interface.
datasets part - load/create dataset.
evaluation part - optimize our algorithm and test others.
