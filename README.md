## Description
Our Project is a Python-based application designed to compare our model to different models available for clustering today. This project aims to find a more efficent method for clustering,with better results.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- The following libraries need to be installed: torch,cxvpy,scipy,sklearn,pandas,numpy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DataAnalysisAndVisualization/Project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Project
    ```


## Usage
To run the project, execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Files
- main.py - our main file for activation, used for creating the results graph.
- data.py - used for loading the datasets for our project
- test.py - used for testing different models and compare between them
- index_models.py - used for initiallize our different models for activation, along with helper functions for each model
